                The 2023 Automotive Packaging Summit was held October 11 & 12th
                at the Peace Center’s Huguenot Mill and Loft in Greenville, SC.
                This year the event once again delivered quality education and
                networking to a sold-out audience of nearly 300 packaging
                professionals from OEMs and Tier 1 Suppliers like GM, BMW,
                Magna, Volvo, Nissan, Plastic Omnium, Caterpillar and Bosch.
              </p>
              <p>
                When asked about the event’s success Dr. Andrew Hurley, Founder
                of The Packaging School shared, “I’m pleased to report that
                AutoPack Summit 2023 received overwhelming positive feedback
                from those in attendance. Networking, education and relationship
                building were cited as benefits of attending, which is a
                testament to the quality audience that flocked to the event.
                Watching so many of the audience members taking notes and
                scheduling future meetings throughout the conference was a
                treat.”

                studies paired by OEMs and Tier 1 Part suppliers, expendable and
                returnable packaging challenges to the quickly evolving
