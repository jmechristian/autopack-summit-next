              Automotive Packaging Summit (APS) from any and all liability or
              claims which may arise from participation in the Event. This
              paragraph shall be inclusive of, but not limited to, any injury or

              adverse weather conditions, or choking. Participant, on behalf of
              Participant and Participant’s successors, agents or assigns,
              hereby forever and unconditionally releases APS, its owners,
              employees, agents, successors in interest and insurers
              (hereinafter referred to as the “Released Entities”), from any and
              all claims, actions, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and

              in the Event. Any liability found on the part of APS shall be
              limited to the cost of participation. Participant further
              acknowledges that APS is in no way liable for any injury to
              participant resulting from Participant’s own conduct or behavior

              designated times at the Event should they choose to do so.
              However, alcohol consumption shall be at Participant’s own
              discretion, risk and liability. APS reserves the right to excuse
              any Participant from the Events if said Participant becomes
              inebriated and misbehaves or has the potential to cause harm to
              him or herself or any other person or persons. If a Participant is
              excused from the Event pursuant to this paragraph, it shall be
              without any sort of reimbursement by APS. All Participants hereby
              assume all risk involved with the consumption of alcohol and
              unconditionally hold APS harmless.

              <strong>Force Majeure: </strong>A In this clause, “Force Majeure”
              means circumstances which are beyond our reasonable control and
              which are reasonably likely to affect the successful delivery of
              the Event or would make it inadvisable, impracticable, illegal, or
              impossible for us to host the Event or perform our obligations
              under these Terms, including circumstances, which directly affect
              the Participants in their home countries resulting in a material
              percentage of the Participants being reasonably likely to be
              prevented from attending the Event.
            </p>
            <p>
              If, as a result of Force Majeure, APS cancels the Event, APS shall

              Participant Fees as soon as reasonably practicable and in any
              event within 90 days from the date of notice of cancellation.

            <p>
              Without prejudice to APS’s obligation to refund any Fees to
              Participants, APS accepts no liability and shall pay no
              compensation where the performance of its obligations is made
              impracticable, illegal or impossible by or as a result of Force
              Majeure.
